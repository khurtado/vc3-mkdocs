These include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Chicago - Research Computing Center\n\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame - Center for Research Computing\n\n\nNational Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)\n\n\nPittsburgh Supercomputing Center (Bridges)\n\n\nOpen Science Grid\n\n\nand more!\n\n\n\n\nInstitutions and resources are added frequently. Check the \nResources\n page for the full list of connected resources in the service.\n\n\n1. Login or Create Account\n\n\nWhen you first visit \nVirtual Clusters\n, you\u2019ll\nbe presented with a Login link in the top right of the screen. Click \u201cLogin\u201d -\nthis will take you to a \nGlobus\n sign-in site.\n\n\n\n\n2. Sign in to Globus\n\n\nYou will then be asked to sign in with your institutional identity, or your\nGlobus ID. If you are using the former, simply type in the name of your\ninstitution and click \"Continue\". Proceed to \nStep 3a\n.\n\n\nOtherwise, click \"Globus ID to sign in\" and proceed to the alternate \nStep 3b\n.\n\n\n\n\n3a. Login with your institutional ID\n\n\nYou should be presented with a login page for your institutional ID, with your\ninstitution\u2019s branding. Go ahead and sign-in now. \n\nNote that your password is not sent to the VC3 or Globus web portals\n. \nContinue to \nstep 4\n.\n\n\n\n\n3b. Login with your Globus ID\n\n\nOnce you have clicked on the \"Globus ID to sign in\" link, you will be presented with the page below. Please, proceed to log in if you already have a globus account, or click on the upper right link to create a new globus account.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are creating a new account, a short form to fill up will be shown next (see below).\n\n\n\n\nAfter you have completed this form, a confirmation e-mail with a verification code will be sent. Copy and paste such code and click on the \"verify\" button.\n\n\n\n\nAfter your account is verified, you will be presented with the page below. Click on \"Continue\" to finalize the sign up process.\n\n\n\n\n4. Complete or update your VC3 profile\n\n\nOnce you have signed in, you\u2019ll be asked to update or complete your VC3 profile\nwith information such as your Institution and any other data we cannot\ndirectly extract from your Globus account. Click \u201cUpdate Profile\u201d once done.\n\n\nNote that other actions are not allowed until the profile is complete. \n\n\nThe \"SSH KEY\" box can be used to upload your public ssh key. \nThis will allow you to access your future clusters in the VC3 infrastructure.\nRemeber: it is the \npublic\n key what needs to be uploaded. \n\n\nIf you do not have a public ssh key, \ninstructions to create it can be found in the link at the top-right corner. \n\n\n\n\n5. Connect an Allocation\n\n\nAfter updating your profile, you can connect an allocation to the VC3 service.\nAn allocation, in VC3, is defined as combination of a username and resource\ntarget that consumes some type of compute unit - regardless of whether it is\nbilled as Service Units (many HPC centers), dollars (AWS, GCE), or priority\n(HTCondor and other opportunistic systems).\n\n\nClicking My Allocations on the left shows all allocations currently associated\nwith your account. You may select a new one by clicking the \"New Allocation\" button.\n\n\n\n\nYou will be able to select a resource target from the drop down menu, and enter\nan account name for the resource. This is the same account name that you use to\nSSH to the remote system.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to create a virtual cluster, the VC3 needs to be able to SSH\nto the remote resource. \nOnce you\u2019ve connected your allocation, the system starts a process to validate it.\n\n\n\n\nFollow the instructions.\nYou will be asked to login to the resource. \nOnce there, just copy and paste the command that is displayed in the box \"step 3\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis token allows the VC3 system to SSH into a cluster as yourself and submit\njobs on your, or your project\u2019s, behalf.\n\n\nOnce the ssh key has been placed in the resource, click on button \"validate\" (step 4).\nYou will notice the progress bar at the top changes color to green with a message \"Ready\"\nwhen VC3 has complete the validation. Now the allocation is ready to be used. \n\n\n6. Defining a Project\n\n\nVC3, as a platform for cooperative scientific computing, allows you create\nprojects to share your allocations and virtual clusters with trusted members of\nyour group, laboratory, or collaboration. To start a new project, click\n\u201cProjects\u201d on the sidebar, then click \u201c+ New Project\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nYou may give your project an arbitrary name and choose initial project members.\nYou are, by default, member of all your projects.\nOnce finished, click \u201cCreate Project\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nYou should be returned to the Projects page, where you will be able to see all\nof your projects and memberships.\nYou can access the configuration of each project in the table by clicking on its name.\nThis way you can add or remove members and/or allocations to a given project.\n\n\n\n\n7. Creating a Cluster Template\n\n\nVC3 allows users to create \u201cCluster Templates\u201d that describe the components of\ntheir virtual cluster, including the type of cluster, \nnumber of head nodes, worker nodes, etc. \nVC3 currently supports HTCondor and WorkQueue clusters with dynamic worker nodes,\nand fixed head nodes.\n\n\nTo define a new template, click the \u201cCluster Templates\u201d link on the left panel, \nand then click the \"+New Cluster Template\" button. \nYou\u2019ll be able to give your cluster a name, select framework, and number of\nworkers. Click \u201cDefine Cluster Template\u201d to finish creating the template.\n\n\nYou should be returned to the Cluster Templates page, where you will be able to see all of your templates.\nYou can access the configuration of each cluster template in the table by clicking on its name.\n\n\n\n\n8. Environments\n\n\nAn Enviroment is a collection of software packages to be included in a virtual cluster. \nClick on \"+New Environment\" to create new ones. \nFrom the \"PACKAGE LIST\" menu you can select one or more packages to be included in your new Enviroment.\n\n\nFrom the second menu you can choose, if needed, the Operative System. If the chosen Operative System\nis not available natively, the system will attempt to provide it via containers.\nPlease, look into the \nresources page\n to check if the\nresource you are planning to use with this environment has container options available in the \n\"features\" section (E.g: singularity).\n\n\n\n\nOnce done, click on \"Create New Enviroment\" button.\nYou should be returned to the Enviroments page, where you will be able to see all of your environments.\nYou can access the configuration of each environment in the table by clicking on its name.\n\n\n9. Resources\n\n\nThe VC3 team curates an ever-expanding list of resources for end-users, with a\nfocus on Campus Clusters, HPC centers, and Cloud resources. You can find these\nresources by clicking the \u201cResources\u201d link on the left panel.\n\n\nYou can also click an individual resource and see expanded information, such as\nbatch system type, links to documentation, etc.\n\n\n10. Launching a Virtual Cluster\n\n\nNow that you have created a Project and associated at least one allocation to it,\nyou are ready to create and launch your cluster.\n\n\nClick on the \"New Virtual Cluster\" button to start creating your new cluster.\n\n\nClick on \"New Virtual Cluster\" to create a new one. \nFollow the steps. \nFirst select a project from the menu and click \"Next\".\nSelect a name for your new Virtual Cluster. Only letters, numbers, dashes and underscores are valid characters for the name of the cluster.\n\n\nSelect a Cluster Template from the menu.\n\n\nSelect an Enviroment. \n\n\nSelect the Allocations you want to be used in this cluster. \n\n\nFinally select an expiration time for your cluster. Default value is 2 hours. \n\n\nWhen ready, click on \"Launch Virtual Cluster\"\n\n\n\n\nYou can then select the cluster template, environment (optional), project and allocation. Every user in your project will be able to log in to your virtual cluster submit node.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you have created your new virtual cluster, you will se in the list (as shown below), with the current state. You can click on the \"Virtual Cluster States\" information menu to see a diagram with the meaning of each state.",

Its special feature is the ability to satisfy dependencies in different ways on different targets, depending on what it finds, e.g. it can tell if a dep is already satisfied, can download a pre-built library, or dynamically compile a dep if needed. Several builders can simultaneously satisfy dependencies in parallel on a resource (provided a shared filesystem).\n\n\n\n\nvc3-client\n\n\n\n\nPackage containing the VC3-aware library for creating, listing, updating, and deleting entities within the infoservice. It also contains a command line interface to the library.\n\n\n\n\nvc3-core\n\n\n\n\nThe VC3 component that coordinates activity within the dynamic infrastructure. One vc3-core exists per virtual cluster Request during its lifecycle. A vc3-core will typically start a vc3-factory, along with any central components the cluster will need (e.g. an HTCondor collector/negotiator/schedd, a WorkQueue catalog, or a Squid server).\n\n\n\n\nvc3-master\n\n\n\n\nPackage containing the long-running daemon, running on the static infrastructure, that manages the lifecycle of all virtual cluster Requests. The vc3-master is a long-running daemon, running on the static infrastructure, that manages the lifecycle of all virtual cluster Requests. It polls the infoservice for new Requests, and spawns vc3-core instances on the dynamic infrastructure to service them. It also handles the generation and processing of all derived entities within the infoservice tree.\n\n\n\n\nvc3-release\n\n\n\n\nThis is a developer package that contains various setup and test utilities, and artifacts needed to create and use a YUM RPM repository.\n\n\n\n\nvc3-resource-tool\n\n\n\n\nThe vc3-resource-tool is a utility to be run by end users on resource targets in order to pair and enable them for usage by the VC3 system.\n\n\n\n\nExternal\n\n\nAllocation\n\n\n\n\nAn Allocation refers to an User and a Resource Each Allocation must be owned by an User. Allocations are divisible/fractionable, and can be given to Projects. Allocations may not be oversubscribed. But unbounded Allocations may be parents of multiple unbounded SubAllocations. Bounded Allocations cannot spawn unbounded SubAllocations. If a Resource grants hard allocation and allows backfill mode, those are two distinct Allocations (one hard and one unbounded)\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\n\n\nThe current mechanism for users to sign-up and create accounts into the VC3 project is by authenticating themselves with their GlobusID account.\n\n\n\n\nMFA\n\n\n\n\nmulti-factor authentication\n\n\n\n\nProject\n\n\n\n\na collection of \u201cAllocations\u201d. It has at least 1 \u201cuser owner\u201d, and 0 or more non-owner members. The owner is also a member.\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\n\n\nEntity that encapsulates all information that defines a particular virtual cluster. Creating a new Request triggers creation of the cluster.\n\n\n\n\nRequest templates\n\n\n\n\na list of pre-existing forms to be used as base for new cluster requests creation.\n\n\n\n\nResource\n\n\n\n\nAny target on which a vc3-builder will run to provide computing power to a virtual cluster.\n\n\n\n\nResource profiles\n\n\n\n\na list of pre-existing forms to be used as base for new resource definition.\n\n\n\n\nService unit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService units are essentially just walltime hours, with minimum charges based on minimum cores or minimum nodes per job. Much like HEPSPEC, the SUs can be normalized/converted based on LINPACK benchmarks. Doc from XSEDE: https://portal.xsede.org/knowledge-base/-/kb/document/bazo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor storage, possibly with multiple allocations per user, examples are scratch disk vs long term storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExotic devices like GPUs may or may not be accounted for, depending on the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSub-Allocation\n\n\n\n\nA SubAllocation can be defined in terms of fraction or units (cpuhours?, $dollars, HEPSPEC) or be unbounded. SubAllocations are children of an Allocation.\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\n\n\n\nEvery User has 0 or more Allocations. Users are owners or members of one or more projects. A User in a project can make Request(s) utilizing project member\u2019s Allocations",
